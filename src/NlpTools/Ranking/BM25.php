/**
 * BM25 is a class for ranking documents against a query.
 *
 * The implementation is based on the paper by Stephen E. Robertson, Steve Walker, Susan Jones, 
 * Micheline Hancock-Beaulieu & Mike Gatford (November 1994).
 * that can be found at http://trec.nist.gov/pubs/trec3/t3_proceedings.html.
 *
 * Some modifications have been made to allow for non-negative scoring as suggested here.
 * https://doc.rero.ch/record/16754/files/Dolamic_Ljiljana_-_When_Stopword_Lists_Make_the_Difference_20091218.pdf
 *
 * We also made use of a delta(Î´) value of 1, which modifies BM25 to account for an issue against
 * penalizing long documents and allowing shorter ones to dominate. The delta values assures BM25
 * to be lower-bounded. (This makes this class BM25+)
